      <li><strong>3.1 Follow All Rules:</strong> You must follow all rules, guidelines, and policies for <em>each</em> Geo Interactive project, platform, game, server, website, or community space you use.

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>5.1 Community Submissions to Projects:</strong> If you intentionally contribute creative work (e.g., art, designs, code, music) for inclusion in a Geo Interactive project, you grant Geo Interactive a perpetual, worldwide, transferable license to use, modify, and distribute that work within GI projects and related promotional materials. If a different license is agreed in writing, that will apply.</li>
